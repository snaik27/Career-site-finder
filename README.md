# Jobs-website-script
Literally just a script to auto-grab URLs from google for the companies listed 

I forgot about HTTPrequest limits and I don't think anyone wants to wait 3 days for a script to finish running, so I'm just abandoning the idea for now. If you can find a workaround please show it to me! In the meanwhile, hopefully the company jobs' app will help you out.
